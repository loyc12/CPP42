>Â plan (?) :

start with an "array" of numbers
create an "array" of pairs of numbers (in order, save last for later if uneven)
clear the "array" of numbers

sort the pairs themselves (biggest first, smallest last)
sort the "array" of pairs based on their first number's value

reinsert the first number of each pair into the "array" of number (in order)
use jacobstal to reinsert the last number from pair into the "array" of numbers (in order)


> thoughts (?) :

have class store values in a vector
only use different containers in the sort functions themselves
