/*
Ford-Johnson Algorithm ( using jacobsthal )

> start with a filled int array and an empty pair array

if the int array lenght is odd
	store one number away

while the int array is not empty
{
	take the first two int
	sort them into a pair ( comp )
	insert said pair into the pair array ( USING JACOBSTHAL ) ( comp )
}

> now the int array is empty and the pair array is full

move the first value of each pair into the int array
insert the second value of each pair into the int array ( USING JACOBSTHAL ) ( comp )

if a number is stored away
	insert it into the int array ( nomrla insert sort ) ( comp )
